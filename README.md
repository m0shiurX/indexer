### 4. Set up your API keys

indexer requires keys from Google and/or IndexNow to submit URLs:

  - Upload the JSON key file in indexer under **API Keys**.

  - Get your secret key from your domain provider or generate one using online tools.
  - Enter the key in the IndexNow section of the app.

The app will rotate between keys if you add multiple, to avoid hitting limits.

### 5. Add URLs for submission

## 🔧 Using the Dashboard

The Next.js dashboard has clear sections:

- **API Keys:** Add, remove, or edit your keys here.
- **Logs:** Review detailed reports on each submission batch.

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter problems, try these steps:

- Make sure your internet connection is stable.
